Two folders for two different projects I created as part as my Coding Career Programme. That is a websiteproject and a js-project.

The websiteproject utilises principles I learned in the Learn HTML and CSS courses. I created a typical web page structure such as a home page, about, and contact page with tags like form, headings and titles.

The js-project was the most challenging but enjoyable project I undertook. I was tasked with creating anything in mind to do with a web page that utilises Javascript. Taking inspiration from learning courses to do with coding at Codecademy, I sourced a list of programming languages from the internet, put them into an array, and each time the page refreshes, a random programming language is listed for people to learn. With a artifical difficulty level, styling dependant on the randomised difficulty level using switch case, and more dynamic web principles.
